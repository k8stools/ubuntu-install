# ubuntu-install

The install.py script is a very basic one.  
This script sets up the vim color to fromthehell (https://github.com/szorfein/fromthehell.vim)  
It tested on Ubuntu 22.04 server.

For now the script has to be runned by root user.  
It downloads and create files in the /root/ directory
